# Module 09-Lab 1: Configuring SharePoint Hybrid'

## Microsoft 365 user interface 

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you may experience user interface (UI) changes that were made following the development of this training content. This will manifest itself in UI changes that do not match up with the detailed instructions presented in this lab manual.

The Microsoft World-Wide Learning team will update this training course as soon as any such changes are brought to our attention. However, given the dynamic nature of cloud updates, you may run into UI changes before this training content is updated. **If this occurs, you will have to adapt to the changes and work through them in the lab exercises as needed.**

## Lab Scenario 

In the labs of this course you are the SharePoint Administrator for Adatum Corporation, and you have a SharePoint 2019 farm deployed in a virtualized lab environment. In this lab, you will configure SharePoint Hybrid Scenarios.

## Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

  - Configure and deploy SharePoint Hybrid scenarios.

## Lab Setup 

  - **Estimated Time:** 60 minutes.

## Instructions

## Before you start

### 1. Review the lab virtual machines

The following are the virtual machines provided in this course. You will log in to the VM as a local administrator. The instructor will provide the sign-in information.

  - LON-DC1: Domain controller
  - LON-SP1: SharePoint Server with SharePoint 2019 installed.
  - LON-SP2: SharePoint Server with SharePoint 2019 installed.
  - LON-SQL: SQL Server with SQL Server management tools installed.

### 2. Review Microsoft 365 tenant

Once you launch the VM, a free trial tenant will be made available to you. The following are the details about the Microsoft 365 tenant:

  - Microsoft 365 E5.

  - 15 licenses with ten pre-assigned (5 available of 15).

  - One Global Administrator (MOD Administrator) and nine normal users have been pre-created.

  - Global Administrator (MOD Administrator) is **admin@YourTenant.onmicrosoft.com**.

**Note:** **YourTenant**.onmicrosoft.com is the domain associated with the Microsoft 365 tenant provided by the lab hosting provider. **YourTenant** is the unique tenant ID and different to each student.

## Exercise 1: Set up your lab environment

In the first exercise you will walk through the steps to setup your lab environment.

### Task 1: Obtain your Microsoft 365 Credentials 

1.  The **M365 Credentials** will be provided by the instructor.

### Task 2: Sign in to Microsoft 365 

In this task you will open Edge browser and navigate to Microsoft 365 Portal to sign in with the credentials obtained in the previous task.

1.  Log on to **LON-SP1** virtual machine as the SharePoint Farm Administrator (Adatum\\SPFarm).

2.  Open **Edge** or **IE** and enter **https://portal.office.com** into the address bar and press **Enter**.

3.  You should be presented a sign in dialog box, if you are directed to the page instead, select **Sign In** from the upper right of the page. If you are presented the sign in dialog box, **copy and paste the M365 Credential Username** into the box presented, select **Next**.

4.  In the next screen, **copy and paste the M365 Credential Password** into the box presented, select **Sign In**.

5.  When it asks if you would like to **Stay signed in?** then select **Yes** to stay signed in.

You have now completed this task and the exercise.

## Exercise 2: Setting up your organization for identity synchronization

You are the security administrator for Adatum Corporation, and you have Microsoft 365 deployed in a virtualized lab environment. In this lab, you will implement identity synchronization between your Microsoft 365 tenant accounts and your local active directory accounts.

### Task 1: Configure your UPN suffix

1.  On **LON-DC1**, log on as **adatum\\Administrator** and use password assigned to your lab.

2.  Run **Windows PowerShell ISE** as administrator, update the UPN suffix for the domain and on the UPN on every user in AD DS with “@**YourTenant**.onmicrosoft.com” (where **YourTenant** is your unique UPN name) for the domain name. To do this, run the following command (remember to change **YourTenant** to your unique UPN name):

    ```powershell
    Import-Module ActiveDirectory
    $upn = "YourTenant.onmicrosoft.com"
    Set-ADForest -Identity Adatum.COM -UPNSuffixes @{Add=$upn}

    $ou = "CN=Users,DC=Adatum,DC=com"
    $oldSuffix = "Adatum.com"
    $password = "Pa55w.rd"

    Get-ADUser -SearchBase $ou -filter {Name -like "user*"} | ForEach-Object {
        $_ | Set-ADAccountPassword -reset -newpassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText $password -Force)
        $_.UserPrincipalName
        $newUpn = $_.UserPrincipalName.Replace($oldSuffix, $upn)
        $_ | Set-AdUser -UserPrincipalName $newUpn -EmailAddress  $newUpn -ChangePasswordAtLogon $false
    }

    $serviceUpn = "spfarm@" + $upn
    Set-ADUser -Identity spfarm -UserPrincipalName $serviceUpn -EmailAddress $serviceUpn   

    ```

3.  To confirm the change, open **Active Directory Administrative** Center, and navigate to the **UserA** under **Users** OU. You should see the value of Users UPN logon been changed to for Yes to **YourTenant**.onmicrosoft.com.

### Task 2: Enable Directory Synchronization
