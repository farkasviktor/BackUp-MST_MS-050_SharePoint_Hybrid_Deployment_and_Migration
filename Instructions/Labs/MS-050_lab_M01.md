## Instructions

## Before you start

### Review the lab virtual machines

The following are the virtual machines provided for this course. You will log in to the VM as a local administrator. The instructor will provide the sign-in information.

  - LON-DC1: Domain controller

  - LON-SP1: SharePoint Server with SharePoint 2019 installed.

  - LON-SP2: SharePoint Server with SharePoint 2019 installed.

  - LON-SQL: SQL Server with SQL Server management tools installed.

## Exercise 1: Configure SharePoint Server 2019 Farm

In the first exercise you will walk through the configuration steps to create a SharePoint 2019 farm. We are starting with LON-SP2 as this will be the server hosting the application and search services. Also, the server which is used to create the farm will be the server which will host the Central Administration web site by default. Recommendations have this service hosted on servers which are not used by end users, such as web front end server roles.

### Task 1 – Run the SharePoint Products Configuration Wizard on LON-SP2 

In this task you will use the SharePoint Products Configuration Wizard to setup a new farm on LON-SP2 server.

You have successfully completed this task. You have finished the first exercise and you can continue to the next one.

## Exercise 2: Install SharePoint Server 2019 updates

In this exercise you will download, install and apply updates to the SharePoint Server 2019 farm.

### Task 1 – Download the latest updates

Before you can install updates, we must first download the updates. Use the following steps to download the updates to each of the SharePoint servers in the farm.

1.  In your Lab Session, switch to **LON-SP1** virtual machine and login as SharePoint Farm Administrator(Adatum\\SPFarm).

2.  Open **Internet Explorer**, and browse to the following URL
    
      - <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/OfficeUpdates/sharepoint-updates>
    
      - You can also go to **Central Admin** \> **Upgrade and Migration** \> **Check Product and patch installation status** \> and select on **Click here for the latest information on available updates for SharePoint Products.** Which will lead you to the same location as the link above.

3.  Select on the latest **KB Number** under **SharePoint 2019 update history** section  
    ![SharePoint 2019 update history](media/M01/image20.png)

4.  The description of the update will load. Scroll down and select the link under **Microsoft Download Center** to be redirected to the download page for the update.  
    ![Microsoft Download Center](media/M01/image21.png)

5.  Download the update from the Microsoft Download Center. Select **English**, Select **Download**. Save the file to the **Downloads** folder on the local server.

6.  Repeat the steps above for LON-SP2.

Once you have downloaded the update file on both SharePoint servers, you have successfully completed this task and can continue with the next task.

### Task 2 – Install the latest updates 

Updates can be installed in parallel on each of the servers. Use the following steps to install the updates to each of the SharePoint servers in the farm.

1.  In your Lab Session, switch to **LON-SP1** virtual machine and login as SharePoint Farm Administrator(Adatum\\SPFarm).

2.  Navigate to the **Downloads** folder in the **File Explorer**

3.  Double-select the KB update file to start the execution of the update on the server. You may see a User Account Control Dialog pop up, if so, select **Yes**.

4.  The Security Update will present a dialog to **accept the Microsoft Software License Terms**. Check the box in the bottom left of the dialog to accept these terms and select **Continue**.

    ![Screenshot showing the Microsoft Software Licensing Terms which must be accepted by the installer in order to continue the installation.](media/M01/image22.png)

5.  While the installation process is happening on LON-SP1, Repeat the steps above for LON-SP2

6.  When both servers show the installation completed dialog box, the installation of the update is complete. It can take about 15 min to install the update.

When the installation of the update is complete on both servers, this task is completed, and you can move to the next task.

### Task 3 – Finalize implementation of updates

After the update has been downloaded and installed, on each server, it must be applied to each server as well. Typical process with a multi-server farm is to first finalize the installation on all servers which do not host central administration, in this case LON-SP1. Then, last, do the server hosting central administration, in this case LON-SP2. Follow the steps below to apply the updates.

1.  In your Lab Session, switch to **LON-SP1** virtual machine and login as SharePoint Farm Administrator(Adatum\\SPFarm).

2.  On the **Start** screen, type **SharePoint 2019 Central Administration**, and **press Enter**.

3.  In Central Administration page, select on **Manage Servers in this farm**. You can see the **version** of the SharePoint Farm is still the old version, and the status for each of the servers should now show **Upgrade Required**.  

    ![Screenshot showing the manage servers in this farm page from central administration. It shows the old version of the farm and shows a status of Upgrade Required for each SharePoint server.](media/M01/image23.png)

4.  On the **Start** screen, type **SharePoint 2019 Products and Configuration Wizard**, and **press Enter**.
