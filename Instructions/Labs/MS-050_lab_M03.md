# Module 03: Manage Site Collections and Permissions 

## Microsoft 365 user interface 

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you may experience user interface (UI) changes that were made following the development of this training content. This will manifest itself in UI changes that do not match up with the detailed instructions presented in this lab manual.

The Microsoft World-Wide Learning team will update this training course as soon as any such changes are brought to our attention.
